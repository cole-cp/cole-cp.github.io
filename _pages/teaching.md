: This is the text that I want indented.  All text on the same line as the preceding colon will be included in this definition.
: If you include a second definition you'll get a new line; potentially separated by a space. <br />Some inline HTML may be supported within this too, allowing you to create new lines without spaces.
: Support for other markdown syntax varies; e.g. we can add a bullet list, but each one's wrapped in a separate definition term, so the spacing may be out.
