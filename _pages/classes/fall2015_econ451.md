Course Materials for Economics 453 - Intermediate Econometrics II (Undergraduate)  

As a graduate student instructor for this course, I created a 12-module class to teach STATA to students who had never used it before. These materials included: 
1) Section hand-outs with descriptive exercises and example blocks of code,  
2) Interactive section STATA programs that allow students to try guided exercises in class, and  
3) Homework assignments.  


These materials are available [here](/assets/teaching/fall2015_econ451/Cole_Econ452_Lessons.zip).
